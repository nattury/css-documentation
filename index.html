                <p>
                    Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its
                    whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as
                    “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on
                    “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the
                    main idea behind the flex layout. </p>
                <p>
                    Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross
                    axis (from cross-start to cross-end).
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>main axis</strong>– The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which
                        flex items
                        are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex_direction
                        property (see below).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>main-start | main-end</strong>– The flex items are placed within the container starting
                        from
                        main-start and going to main-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>main size</strong>– A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension,
                        is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’
                        property, whichever is in the main dimension.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>cross axis</strong>– The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis.
                        Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>cross-start | cross-end</strong>– Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the
                        container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end
                        side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>cross size</strong>– The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross
                        dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’
                        that is in the cross dimension.
                    </li>

                <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/">W3C Candidate
                        Recommendation as of October 2017</a>) aims at
                    providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container,
                    even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).</p>
                <p>
                    The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’
                    width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of
                    display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or
                    shrinks them to prevent overflow.
                </p>
                <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block
                    which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages,
                    they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it
                    comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note: </strong>Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and
                    small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

                <p>This is a shorthand for the flex_direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex

                    size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>

                        doesn’t make sense with the flex_direction, then it behaves like start.</li>
                    <li><strong>right:</strong> items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t

                        them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both
                        sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of
                        space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.</li>
                    <li><strong>space-evenly:</strong> items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items

                </ol>
                <p>Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got
                    support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed
                    charts. The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.</p>

                <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a
                    length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height
                    property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content
                    keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s
                    hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.
                </p>
                <code>.item {
    flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
    }</code>
                </p>
                <p>If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is
                    distributed based on its flex-grow value. <a

                <p>This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third
                    parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it
                    with a single number value, it’s like 1 0.</p>
                <code>.item {
    flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? 
    || <'flex-basis'> ]
    }</code>
                <p>It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The
                    shorthand sets the other values intelligently.</p>

                <p>This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.</p>
